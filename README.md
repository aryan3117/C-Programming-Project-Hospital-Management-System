# C-Programming-Project-Hospital-Management-System

The Hospital Management System is a C program that helps manage patients, doctors, and appointments.

It allows users to:
Register patients (store name, age, gender, problem)
Book appointments (choose department and select doctor)
Search doctors by name
Display messages or errors for valid and invalid inputs

It uses structures, arrays, and functions to store and process data.

This project also solves common problems hospitals face, such as:
Difficulty in tracking patient records
Manual appointment booking errors
Searching for doctors across departments
